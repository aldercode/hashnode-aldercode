## On choosing a personal blogging platform

As always, Catalin Pit wrote a [great article](https://catalins.tech/should-developers-use-an-existing-blogging-platform-or-build-a-blog-from-scratch). This time, it's about choosing a blogging platform.

This got me thinking. I already use Hashnode for my dev blog and I love the platform - it does everything I want it to and then some. In fact, I reviewed the platform after using it for just a few days - [read my early days review here.](https://blog.aldercode.com/2-days-on-hashnode-early-impressions) I've grown to love it even more since writing that. 

Do you want to know why? Was that linked review far too TL;DR? Here's why: It just works. It does what it says on the box. No fussing with updates-this and tweaks-that. Set it up in a couple of minutes and get to writing. 

### A different kind of blog ###

But, I want to create a personal blog too. This one will be entirely unrelated to tech - way more focused on humorous articles about my life as a suburban dad. I post a lot of these musings and anecdotes on my personal Facebook page and appropriate groups and the reception is usually great. 

So, as soon as I decided to go ahead with this I immediately thought: "Best I find a suitable platform. Hashnode is for devs, right?"

But then I thought "well, why not Hashnode?" Hashnode checks all the boxes that Catalin listed: custom domain, letting someone else handle the tech side, the ability to customise. Additionally: AMP, sharing functionality being built in already, newsletters, automatic SSL... the list goes on. 

Sure, the local audience is currently primarily tech-focused, but so what? If my posts are good they'll attract an outside audience just like with any platform. 

Besides, I doubt I'd hear any complaints about bringing more readers to the platform.

## Keeping it separate ##

If you're wondering why I don't simply post it right here, well, I previously made the mistake of blogging on a single site on whatever topic I felt like writing about at the time. I realise, in hindsight, that this may not be ideal. In order to grow and retain a loyal readership, I feel that a blog needs focus, or at least a general direction. 

For example, if you find my blog because you're looking for an article about basic HTML, you're in the right place. But, if the next post is then about something funny that my daughter said to me, well, that's an entirely different topic and even style of post. It doesn't really make sense to me to do it that way.

Plus, there's so much that I want to write about that doesn't really fit the general focus of a dev blog.

Thus, this blog will continue to be about my dev/coding journey. I already have a [second blog](https://codingclimate.com/), using WordPress, as that's what I always used until discovering Hashnode. That one is looking into climate tech (and which is way overdue for some new posts). Now, it seems I'll be adding a third - coming soon.

Three blogs... I wonder where I'll find the time. But, that's my problem to solve.

Does anyone know if people are already using Hashnode for 'normal' or 'personal', i.e. non-tech, blogs yet? If so, great. If not, well then, let me be the first.

On that note, I'm off to be a real dev: I'm going to go buy another domain name.
