## Growing a climate tech portal

Those that know me are likely aware that not only am I hard at work trying to seriously up my game at coding, while kickstarting a freelance website design business (using mainly WordPress for now) but that I'm also passionate about climate science.

I even went ahead and got myself a degree in the field!

To this end, over the last few months, I've been working on starting, and now growing, a website ([Coding Climate](https://codingclimate.com/)) devoted to looking into the field of **climate tech**: the junction of technology and climate science.

There are some truly exciting projects and tech startups out there aiming to help climate issues by incorporating the latest and greatest technologies. 

**This is where we, the coders and developers of the world, come in.**

As Hashnode is chock-a-block FULL of highly-accomplished devs, I imagine there are quite a few of you out there just as interested in the field as I am.

I thus invite each and every one of you to not only check out the [website](https://codingclimate.com/), but also to **contribute your own dev and tech-related content**. 

There's no reason for the platform to remain merely a place for *my* views on these tech startups - let's hear what you have to say, what you're working on and which tech startups you're either working at or founding in the field of climate tech.

I've also recently started a newsletter for the site, and the second issue went out today. Allow me to paste the content thereof here to give you a better idea of some of the plans for Coding Climate:

## Newsletter Issue No. 2: ##

So, what‚Äôs been happening on codingclimate.com?

Well, two new posts about some great learning opportunities went up:

A brief overview of **On Deck‚Äôs Climate Tech Fellowship**.
Their second cohort‚Äôs application period closed a couple of weeks ago, but, given its popularity, I‚Äôd imagine there‚Äôll be a third in the near future, if you‚Äôre keen. Read more about it [here](https://codingclimate.com/on-decks-climate-tech-fellowship-5-days-left-to-apply/).

**CONNECT University Summer School 2021 | Digital for our Planet**. A look into this free Summer School which:

> ‚Ä¶aims to share knowledge and information about the way climate change is interconnected with digital transformation.

While it may have wrapped up on Friday last week, recordings are available for on-demand viewing. More info and the agenda are available [here](https://codingclimate.com/starting-monday-21-june-digital-for-our-planet/).

### Expanded focus ###
Other items in the works on the site include a slight shift in (or rather, expansion of) its focus:

Instead of simply serving as an avenue for me to post about interesting climate tech projects, I‚Äôm keen to make it a bit more of a climate tech portal. The aim is to achieve this by adding:

* A ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Who in Climate Tech‚Äù directory. There are SO many great startups and projects out there in this field. So, why not collate them? Work is well underway on this. Launching soon!

* A climate tech jobs board. There seem to be a lot of great vacancies out there. Let‚Äôs collate as many of these into a single portal as we can. Also coming soon!

* Finally, to expand on what I wrote above: instead of me simply writing about my own take on these climate tech projects, let‚Äôs open up the floor:
Have you written about an interesting project or startup in this field? If not, would you like to? Why not share it with Coding Climate‚Äôs readers?
Let‚Äôs grow this community! Please [get in touch](https://codingclimate.com/contact/) and let‚Äôs have a chat.

On that note, allow me to bring this newsletter issue to a close here. Anyone who knows me knows that I can ramble on about climate science, technology, and the junction of the two for hours! I‚Äôll save my long-winded (yet ultimately fascinating üòâ) diatribes for the site, shall I?

Thanks for reading!

Until the next time.

Stuart
