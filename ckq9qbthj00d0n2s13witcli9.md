## Proofreading and editing blog posts as a service

Hi, fellow tech bloggers!

Just a quick note to let you know about a new service I'm offering: proofreading and editing of blog posts.

There are so many bloggers here in the developer community that there's definitely (hopefully?) a market.

I'm fully aware that most write mainly for themselves and a select audience. They may thus have zero inclination to spend more than a few dollars on such a thing, if anything at all. I will therefore have to ensure that it's a quick, easy and, more importantly, cheap process.

### Feedback requested ###

On that note: I'm keen to hear from you, my fellow tech bloggers. Is this something you'd be interested in? 

Yes? No? Maybe?

It would entail a quick review of the vocabulary, spelling and grammar used, not your actual content per se.

Please let me know in the comments or via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aldercode).

First order of business: Checking my own blogs to ensure that no sneaky typos crept in...

Next step: Spinning up a quick website to explain my service offering.

From the US? Not a problem! I won't force you to use the letter u. ðŸ˜‰

US and UK English editing offered.

Interested? Get in touch: edit [at] aldercode [dot] com or reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aldercode).

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this!

Thanks in advance.

Stuart
